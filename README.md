# Glidebot

## About

Glidebot will:

* Check out a github repo
* Run `glide update`
* Have any dependencies changed? Then create a pull request.

Glidebot will not build your project - we expect you have a CI system
like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) in
place for that.

## Add your project

If you have a public project, feel free to add yours with a PR on
`projects.txt`.
